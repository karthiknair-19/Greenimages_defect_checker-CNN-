# Crop Disease Detection and Cure Recommendation System

The Crop Disease Detection and Cure Recommendation System is a machine learning project that utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the ResNet V2 architecture. This system empowers farmers to upload images of defected plants, identifies crop diseases, and provides recommended solutions to protect and cure the crops.

## Features

- **Crop Disease Detection:** Accurate identification of diseases in crop images using ResNet V2 CNN.
- **Cure Recommendation:** Providing farmers with recommended solutions and treatments for identified crop diseases.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use web application for farmers to upload images and receive prompt results.
- **Crop Protection:** Enabling farmers to take proactive measures to protect their crops from diseases.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Crop Disease Detection and Cure Recommendation System locally:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crop-disease-detection.git
$ cd crop-disease-detection
$ pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install necessary dependencies
```

Make sure to replace `yourusername` and `crop-disease-detection` with your GitHub username and project name.

### Usage

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   $ python app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
3. Upload an image of the defected plant to receive disease diagnosis and cure recommendations.

```python
# Example code snippet for integrating the system into other projects (if applicable)
from crop_disease_detection import CropDiseaseDetector

detector = CropDiseaseDetector()
result = detector.detect_and_recommend_cure("path/to/defected_plant_image.jpg")
print(result)
```
